## **Inspiration üí°**

Given the problem statement of addressing **low engagement in water conservation education**,  our team regrouped for brainstorming sessions and extensive research to determine the most effective solution. Through collaborative efforts and multiple meetings, we came up with **WaterSense**, a maze-based arcade game that combines fun gameplay with knowledge-building. This solution aims to leverage gamification to captivate users while gaining knowledge about water conservation.


## **About the Game üçÅ**

**WaterSense Game** is a session-based maze arcade game where users can take on the role of an educator to create game sessions and invite students to participate.

### **Game Storyline**

Flo, the water-efficiency hero, embarks on a mission to save water by navigating through water pipes and answering questions about water conservation. However, it must avoid the Water Wasters‚Äînasty monsters symbolizing bad water habits.

### **Objectives of the Game**

- The goal is to move around the maze while avoiding the water wasters for 180 seconds. The longer you survive without getting caught by them, the higher your score will be.
- Answer water-conservation questions to earn points and progress through levels.

---

### **How to Play**

1. **Session Creation:** An educator creates a session and invites students to join.
2. **Gameplay:**
    - Use the keyboard's arrow keys to move Flo through the maze.
3. **Scoring:**
    - Gain 10 points for each 30 secs spent in the game.
    - Lose 10 points for contact made with the Water Wasters.
    - Earn 10 points for correctly answering a question.
4. **Winning the Game**
    
    The game ends when:
    
    - All questions are answered, and Flo successfully avoids water wasters.
    - Flo loses all three lives after being caught by Water Wasters.
    - The final score will be added to a leaderboard, so you can see how you compare with other players!


## **Core Features**

1. **Educational Gameplay:** Players learn practical water-saving tips through interactive questions and scenarios.
2. **Session Management:** Allows educators to manage gameplay sessions for groups and adding structure to learning.
3. **Basic Animations:** Interactive visual effects, including water flow and character movement.
4. **Score Tracking:** Track progress with a point system and achievements.
5. **Simple Leaderboard:** Promotes friendly competition, encouraging players to improve their water conservation knowledge.


## **How We Built It**

We adopted an **Agile methodology** to ensure effective collaboration and steady progress. Tasks were divided based on the core features, with weekly sprints for regular updates and problem-solving.

### **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend:**
    - React framework for building a responsive, dynamic UI.
    - WebSockets for real time updates on the UI.
- **Backend:**
    - Node.js and Express.js for API creation.
    - WebSockets (via Socket.io) for real-time session management.
    - [Postman for APIs documenation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/20503181/2sAYJ6Dzzy)
- **Design:**
    - [Figma for design prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/5kcnQd5XFul4p6fgjrvCc8/Untitled?node-id=0-1&p=f).
- **Documentation:**
    - Notion for managing project details and documentation.
- **Deployment:**
    - **Backend:** [Railway](https://watersense.up.railway.app/).
    - **Frontend:** [Vercel](https://water-sense.vercel.app/).


## Key Challenges & Our Solutions

- Choosing the most effective solution to address the problem statement.

Solution: Conducted multiple brainstorming sessions and research to evaluate different options.

- Learning to work with new technologies like socket.io for the first time, which required mastering new skills.

Solution: Explored documentation, followed tutorials, and built small prototypes to gain hands-on experience.

- Managing Back-and-Forth Communication: Coordinating between the backend and UI teams was difficult due to differences in data expectations, API structures, and integration timelines.

Solution: We established structured sync meetings, maintained clear documentation, and used collaboration tools to ensure alignment.

- Scoping the Project: Balancing feature priorities while keeping the project within scope was a challenge. Ensuring key functionalities were included without overextending the timeline required careful planning.

Solution: We prioritised features based on impact and feasibility, collaborated with stakeholders for alignment, and iteratively refined the scope to focus on core functionalities.

- Designing backend endpoints that could efficiently handle concurrent requests was a technical challenge.

Solution: Conducted extensive research on the best design for the backend system.


## Accomplishments We‚Äôre Proud Of

- Successfully developed a game tailored for our primary audience: school students (ages 8-16) which ensures an engaging and interactive learning experience.
- Provided educators with a structured, interactive platform to teach water conservation effectively in both classroom and home settings
- Combined interactive gameplay with educational content, ensuring that students not only enjoy playing but also learn important water-saving habits.

## Metrics We Aim to Achieve

- A 40% increase in water conservation knowledge among users.
- High engagement levels measured through session participation and leaderboard statistics.


## **What We Learned**

- The importance of teamwork and collaboration in tackling complex challenges.
- Gaining hands-on experience with new technologies and tools.
- Exploring how gamification can effectively enhance learning outcomes.


## **What‚Äôs Next for WaterSense ‚è≠Ô∏è**

- **Customizable Quizzes:** Allow educators to create their own conservation questions.
- **Expanded Gameplay:** Introduce new game modes to cover more conservation topics.
